        <div class="introduction">
            <p>Welcome to this interactive guide to Model United Nations! Join Panagiotis Domvros, President of PyleaMUN, alongside Vangelis Papadopoulos, President of the Executives, and Eleftheria Paidaraki, Deputy President of the GA, as they explain the core workings of an MUN conference in a concise and easy-to-understand way for newcomers.</p>
        </div>

                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Vangelis, let's start at the very beginning: The Roll Call.
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Thanks, Mr. Domvros! So, Roll Call is the very first step within an MUN conference. It's basically the chairs listing which nations are present and which nations are not, just like in a high school classroom where your teacher will list who is present and who is not. Itâ€™s as simple as that. But in the MUN conference, there are a few minor details that you really need to focus upon. So when the chairs call on your nation's name, for example, 'the delegate of South Africa,' you must raise your placard first. You can put it down afterwards.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Then, you will have to respond with one of two answers, and these two answers are up to you. The first choice is: 'The delegate of South Africa is present.' The second choice is: 'The delegate of South Africa is present and voting.' So what's the difference between these two answers? When you choose 'present' only, this means you have the right to abstain, or to not vote, during the voting procedures, including for the draft resolution later on. But if you choose 'present and voting,' this means you have a strong will and a strong commitment to always vote Yes or No during every single voting procedure. If you choose 'present and voting,' you have to vote. You must vote. But if you only choose 'present,' then you have the right not to intervene in the voting itself.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Eleftheria, what are "Points" in MUN, and how do they help delegates?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Points are ways delegates can address specific needs or issues during the conference. There are three important points that you must remember. The first is the Point of Personal Privilege. This is, in simple terms, a way to help you if you want to go to the toilet, if you feel uncomfortable, or if you feel sick during the conference. What you need to do is raise your placard and say, 'The delegate of, let's say for example, the United States of America, would like to raise a point of personal privilege'. Afterwards, you will have to say the reason for the privilege itself.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Next, there is the Point of Order. When you raise your placard and say, 'The delegate of the United States of America would like to raise a point of order,' this means you're notifying and reminding the chairs that they have missed a step within the MUN process itself. Maybe they forgot to mention the other delegates within the roll call, or maybe they forgot to mention the rules of the conference. It's going to be really confusing if you don't ask or remind the chairs regarding their misstep, so don't forget to raise a point of order if you think the conference itself is a little confusing or out of step.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                The next point, and the last, is the Point of Information. This is where you raise a point to increase your proactivity and curiosity within the conference. When you raise your placard and say, 'The delegate of the United States of America would like to raise a point of information,' you're basically asking other delegates in the room about their position paper, their point of view, or their actions regarding the topic at hand. For example, 'The delegate of the United States of America would like to raise a point of information to the delegate of India regarding the topic...' and afterwards, you will ask your question to the delegate of India.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Vangelis, can you tell us about the different types of motions delegates will encounter?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Certainly, Mr. Domvros! The first motion is called the Moderated Caucus. This usually happens most of the time during an MUN conference. This starts by the chairs saying, 'Are there any motions on the floor?'. When they say that, they're basically inviting the delegates in the room to raise up their placards and say what subtopics they want to debate or discuss. Their motions will then be submitted and listed. Afterwards, there will be a voting procedure where the majority vote will choose which motion will be discussed in the debate session. During a moderated caucus, you must also include a speaking time limit. So when you say your subtopic, you also have to say how many minutes should be enough to discuss it. For example, a 15-minute speaking time limit for the topic of child slavery. If there are 15 speakers, this means each speaker will get one minute per session.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Finally, the Unmoderated Caucus, the second motion. An unmoderated caucus is a motion that usually happens during the last stages of an MUN conference. During this time, you have a freer ranged time limit, basically from 20 to 40 minutes, to make alliances with other nations and to create blocks that will soon participate in the draft resolution. This will surely help you create a perfect, efficient draft resolution that will soon be presented.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Forming alliances sounds important! That leads us to a key outcome of the conference: the Draft Resolution. What exactly is a Draft Resolution?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                A draft resolution is basically a sheet of paper that contains all the strategies and solutions your alliance has created in order to counter or solve the problem being discussed. Whether it's to solve climate change, terrorism, or child safety, your job is to list as many solutions as possible to find a real resolution to the problem itself. But you must remember that there has to be a deeper, more complete and precise structure, and you must follow the structure if you want to win.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Alright, let's get to the structure. You start with your committee's name, whether it's UNHCR, UNICEF, or UNESCO. Afterwards, you go to the part of the signatories and the sponsors. The sponsors are listed above the signatories and are the nations that took part in writing or typing the draft resolution. Afterwards, you write the signatory section. These are the names of the countries that did not take part in the writing or typing but were part of the discussions and arguments.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Afterwards, you must write all the problems to identify why this topic is so concerning. First, you write the topic. Then, you write in dot points why this issue is concerning, what this nation has been suffering from, and what are the critical points regarding the topic. Afterwards, this is the final piece of the cake. You just need to remember: you write again in dot points the resolutions, the solutions. For example, 'We can solve climate change by doing this, we can solve climate change by doing that...' You must have at least five solutions regarding the topic.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Once you're done writing the solutions, you submit the paper to the chair, whether it's through Gmail or Google Drive. And this is not finished yet. You will have to send one representative from the alliance to go in front of everyone else to present the contents of your draft resolution. Every block must send one representative. By the end of each presentation, there will be a major vote that decides who will be the winner of the draft resolution, whose draft resolution is better, who has more efficient resolutions, and so on.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> That's a thorough explanation of the Draft Resolution! Now, speaking of getting ready, how does one prepare for an MUN conference?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Preparing for an MUN conference involves a few key steps to ensure you're ready to represent your assigned nation effectively. First, you'll need to research your assigned country's foreign policy and its stance on the specific topics being discussed at the conference. This involves understanding their history, economy, political system, and their relationships with other countries.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Exactly! Once you have a good grasp of your country's general position, you'll delve deeper into the specific agenda topics. Research the issues thoroughly, looking at different perspectives, existing international agreements, and potential solutions. This will help you formulate your nation's viewpoint and prepare for debates.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Will a country profile help with that preparation?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Absolutely, a country profile is extremely helpful! It's essentially a summary of your assigned nation, encompassing its history, economic situation, political structure, and its relationships with other countries.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Think of it as your nation's resume. Having a solid country profile allows you to understand *why* your nation holds certain views on global issues and helps you anticipate how they might react in a debate. It's foundational to representing your country authentically.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Will I have to prepare some papers for the conference?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Yes, you will! The main paper you'll need to prepare is called a position paper.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Your position paper outlines your country's stance on the topics being discussed in the conference. It's where you present your nation's viewpoint on the problems and the solutions you propose. Think of it as a formal statement of your country's policies.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                <img src="domvros.png" alt="Panagiotis Domvros">
                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> Is there anything else that a delegate should consider or prepare for?
            </summary>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Yes! Beyond the formal papers and research, delegates should definitely focus on public speaking skills. You'll be presenting your country's views, participating in debates, and explaining your draft resolution, so being able to articulate your thoughts clearly and confidently is key.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Building on that, negotiation and diplomacy skills are incredibly important. Remember the Unmoderated Caucus where you form alliances and blocks? That's where your ability to persuade, compromise, and build consensus with other delegates really comes into play to create a strong draft resolution.
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                And finally, active listening and critical thinking. During debates and caucuses, you need to listen carefully to what other delegates are saying, understand their positions, and then formulate your responses and strategies accordingly. This helps you identify common ground for alliances or points of disagreement that you need to address.
            </div>

        <details>

                <span class="speaker-name">Mr. Domvros:</span> And lastly, will it help me to go through the PyleaMUN site (pyleamun.gr) for preparation?

            <div>
                <img src="vangelis.png" alt="Vangelis Papadopoulos">
                Absolutely! The PyleaMUN website, pyleamun.gr, will be an invaluable resource for your preparation. It's likely to contain specific details about the upcoming conference.

            <div>
                <img src="eleftheria.png" alt="Eleftheria Paidaraki">
                Exactly! You'll probably find the conference agenda, committee topics, assigned countries, and perhaps even example position papers or rules of procedure. It's the official source for all the logistics and unique aspects of our PyleaMUN conference. You should definitely explore it thoroughly!
